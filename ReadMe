Placement is a serious buisness. Speed Maths is an important skill for cracking the written tests for placements. My app has helped my friends and classmates for preparing basic maths.
The app has following features:
1 for Addition
2 for Subtraction
3 for multiplication
4 for Division(Only integer part)
5 for Adding 2 Squares
6 for Subtracting squares
7 for Adding cube
8 for Subtracting cubes
9 for remainder
10 for Random type questions

You can create a new test by selecting number of question, type of questions, time limited question. The App reports the analysis of the time taken and score. I and my friends found it useful. Hope you all find too!


Please suggest new features. I want to further work on this to add new features to make it better.
